        <h2><center>PRIVACY POLICY</center></h2>
        Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.<br>
        We may collect Personal Information from you such as email address, phone number or mailing address when you choose to request information about our Services, register for APP_NAME newsletter or a program that we may offer from time to time, request to receive customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us.<br>
        In some cases we may collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.<br><br>

        <strong>We will not share any Personal Information that we have collected from or regarding you with any third-party company or business partner.</strong>
        <br><br>

        <strong>MODIFYING YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br>
        You can access and modify the Personal Information associated with your Account through your Account settings or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@yourdomain.com">support@yourdomain.com</a>.<br>
        If you want us to delete your Personal Information and your Account, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@yourdomain.com">support@yourdomain.com</a> with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.
        <br><br>

        <strong>RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIVICATION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION</strong><br>
        You may inquire as to whether APP_NAME is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate.

        <br><br>
        Although APP_NAME makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
        <br><br>

        We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your Personal Information) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.<br>
        By using the App/Site or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Site or sending an e-mail to you. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing.
        <br><br>
